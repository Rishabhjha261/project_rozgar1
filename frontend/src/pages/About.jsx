        Rozgar is a mobile-first job discovery platform built to help blue-collar and semi-skilled workers find nearby employment quickly and easily. While most job portals are designed for corporate professionals, Rozgar focuses on workers such as maids, drivers, security guards, delivery partners, plumbers, electricians, and helpers—users who often face barriers like low literacy, limited English proficiency, and lack of access to complex digital tools.

        Our goal is to reduce friction in job discovery by keeping the experience simple, visual, and fast. Rozgar emphasizes category-based browsing, large tap-friendly interfaces, and minimal text so users can find relevant jobs without filling long forms or navigating complicated flows. Features like voice search, location-assisted sorting, and regional-language readiness are designed to make the platform accessible to a wider audience.Trust is a core pillar of Rozgar. The platform includes verified and unverified job indicators, reporting mechanisms, and admin moderation tools to help maintain a safe and reliable ecosystem for both workers and employers. Employers can easily post job listings, while workers can quickly browse and apply to opportunities nearby.

        Rozgar is built as a full-stack MERN application with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and real-world usability. It serves as a prototype for how technology can be adapted to the needs of blue-collar workers, bridging the gap between opportunity and accessibility.
